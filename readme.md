## Laravel Filters

Need to filter database results with a query string? Here's a beautiful, easy to extend solution to keep your code super tidy.  I am implementing filters with Vue. Driven from the backend, filters update automatically and push to the query string so a user can continue where they left off. I'll also generate pagination that seamlessly works alongside everything, keeping it lean and clean as we go.
